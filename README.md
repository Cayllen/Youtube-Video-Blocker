# Youtube Video Blocker

## Hide annoying videos on YouTube from any channel you want

---

### In it's current state it is broken as of 4/20/17 due to some changes that have been brought upon us by youtube/google. If you would like to help in getting this back up into working order then just push some pull requests and I will gladly accept them after reviewing the code

### I don't know how much time or if/when I will get around to actually working on fixing everything as my time is limited on projects

## What It Does

######  Video Blocker allows you to hide videos from channels that you don't like. You can specify these channels by right-clicking on a link to a video on YouTube or by adding them manually via the options page. You can also hide videos from multiple channels at once, by using a wildcard or adding regular expressions. Blocking videos with certain keywords in their title is also possible! For more information on how to do this exactly, please visit the help section at the settings after installing this extension. Every item you add to your block-list can now also be protected with a password!

######  Good luck and happy video blocking!
